        composer install

        php artisan storage:link  

- Run PHP build-in development server on the host machine

        php -S localhost:8000 -t public  

- Navigate to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)

- Enable Laravel Task Scheduling

    1. Open the cron tab file
    
            crontab -e
            
    2. Add the following line and save
            
            * * * * * php <path-to-project>/artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
  
  On Windows:
  
  Open the Terminal as Administrator, navigate to the project's root folder and run:
    
        schtasks /create /sc minute /mo 1 /tn "RPG SCHEDULER" /tr %cd%\scheduler.bat
        
    To disable the annoying command-line pop-up each time the task runs:
    
    1. Open Windows "Run" dialog by pressing "Windows Key + r"
    2. Enter type "Taskschd.msc" and press Enter. This will open the "Task Scheduler".
    3. In Task Scheduler's "Active Tasks" section find the "RPG SCHEDULER" task and double-click it.
    4. In the left "Actions" panel click "Properties". This will open "Properties" pop-up.
    5. In the pop-up select the "Run whether user is logged in or not" and press Enter.
    You maybe asked for your Windows user's password to complete the process.
        
  To remove the scheduled task you can use
  
        schtasks /delete /tn "RPG SCHEDULER" /f

### Using Admin Dashboard
[Voyager](https://laravelvoyager.com/) has been integrated into the project as an Admin Dashboard.

To use the Admin:

- Register a user in the application (You can skip this step if you already have a user).
- Give the user the admin role by running:

        php artisan voyager:admin-user <user email>
        
- Navigate to [http://localhost:8000/admin](http://localhost:8000/admin).
- Log in with the user credentials (If not logged in automatically).

Further information about using Voyager can be found on its [official website](https://laravelvoyager.com/).
